It doesn't take long to realize that there is **a lot** of repetition in FFBE: War of the Visions.  At it's core, the game is fun, but when it comes to collecting equipment and collecting event medals you run into a wall.  You can either no-life your way to success, or figure out some way to automate it.

Unless you want to have your phone occupied by a gacha game all day, you'll probably want to setup an emulator.  Which gives you the power to setup macros.

Macros can get you part of the way there, but there can be unexpected events like the game client crashing or the emulator freezing up that interrupts your macro.

I've developed my own macro tool to solve these issues that I make available through [my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/wotvbot) and I've started this site to collect information about WOTV emulation, macroing, and also to hold information about my custom tool.
